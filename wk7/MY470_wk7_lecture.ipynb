    "- Purpose:\n",
    "    - **The assert statement is used to check if a condition is true**. \n",
    "    - **If the condition is false, it raises an AssertionError.** \n",
    "    - Assertions are typically **used during development and debugging** to ensure that certain conditions hold true in the code, and they can be turned off globally when the code is run in optimized mode (with the -O flag).\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use it:\n",
    "- To check invariants or assumptions in your code that should always be true (e.g., \"this variable should never be None\").\n",
    "- **For debugging and testing**: Use assert to make sure certain conditions are met during development or **in unit tests.**\n",
    "- For internal consistency checks: **If a condition is something that should never happen (i.e., it indicates a bug or programming error), assert can be used to catch it early.**\n",
    "- To document expectations in code: When you want to ensure that certain conditions hold true at specific points in your program and make it clear to developers."

    "Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Error Handling vs. Debugging:\n",
    "    - try-except is used for handling runtime errors that could arise due to external factors or invalid input.\n",
    "    - **assert is used for debugging and internal consistency checks**, asserting conditions that should never be violated during normal execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Control Flow:\n",
    "    - try-except provides a way to gracefully handle errors and **allows your program to continue running even if an error occurs.**\n",
    "    - **assert is intended to stop execution when a condition is violated, indicating a bug in the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Impact on Production Code:\n",
    "    - assert statements can be disabled in optimized Python runs (with the -O flag), so they should not be relied upon for production error handling.\n",
    "    - try-except is always active and should be used for handling real exceptions in production code.\n"

    "When to use which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Use try-except for runtime error handling where you expect things might go wrong (e.g., user input, file I/O, external resources).\n",
    "- 2. **Use assert for debugging or when you want to enforce a condition that should never fail in your code and should be caught immediately if it does.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "- try-except: You’re reading a file. The file might not exist or there might be permission issues, so you wrap the operation in try-except to handle these cases gracefully.\n",
    "- assert: You’re implementing a function that calculates the square root of a number. You might use assert to ensure that the input is non-negative, as a negative number is an invalid input for the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- try-except: Used for error handling at runtime when an operation may fail or an exception might occur.\n",
    "- assert: Used for debugging and ensuring certain conditions are met during development, and typically for things that should never fail under normal conditions."
